# ChatSimple
Personal Project:

     Purpose:
     
          To Learn C++
          Develop strong OOP practice
          Better develop through git-like environments
          To begin development of features for future projects
          
    Program Outline:
    
               A simple chat program where NPCs, and a user, can interact between each 
          other via chat messages relative to a simple time system. Actors, NPCs or a user,
          can choose to interact by sending messages or wait. Program termination occurs when
          the user chooses to exit.
          OPTIONAL: Save state on exit and load prior exit-state
          
          To add in:
          Interactions are encapsulated by discussion groups. A discussion group is created and 
          maintained by two actors, NPCs or an user and a NPC, sending messages to the other. 
          When a discussion group contains one actor, or less, then it ceases to exist.
